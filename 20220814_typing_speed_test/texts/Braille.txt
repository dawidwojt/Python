'Braille' is a system of writing especially for the blind. This system was perfected by a Frenchman Louis Braille (1809- 52). Louis Braille himself was a blind. Louis Braille went blind following a childhood accident in his early age. Braille is named after its creator, Louis Braille. Braille is a special alphabet used by the blind. The alphabet is marked by raised dots on stiff paper which blind persons can understand by the touch of their fingers. Each letter in the Braille alphabet consists of one or more raised dots. The number and arrangement of these dots distinguish one character from another. Books in Braille have to be quite thick. This is because raised marks are punched out in rows across each page. There are many books written in Braille. Blind people can be taught how to read Braille. There are also machines that help blind people to write in Braille.
