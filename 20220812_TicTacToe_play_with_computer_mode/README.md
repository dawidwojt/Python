This project is a Tic Tac Toe game with a code component giving the possibility to play with a computer.
You can play either in 2 player mode or with a computer.
Even though in 2 player mode game seems simple, I paid special attention to gameplay in computer mode.
The computer won't let you win easily, what's more, it'll do its best to win thanks to sets of conditions that make it the most advanced player.
