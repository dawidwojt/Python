# 20220814_Typing_Speed_Test
This project is an app that checkes how fast can you type.
You have one minute to type as much words as possible, case sensitivity, commas, dots etc. are very important.
The app uses Tk Inter and the whole user experience is moved into a new screen. 
I've put special care into ensuring that the user knows what word should they write - there is a underline in front of the first letter of a current word.
But if user make a mistake, they can still make a good score, because score mechanizm checkes for right words not only in the exact place that the word should have been put, but also around 5 words each side.
