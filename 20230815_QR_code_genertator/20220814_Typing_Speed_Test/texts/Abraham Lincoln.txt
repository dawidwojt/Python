Abraham Lincoln was born on February 12, 1809 in Kentucky, United
States. His father's name was Thomas Lincoln and mother's name was
Nancy Hanks Lincoln. He was born into a poor family, who did not have
a good home to live in nor any means of getting education for
children. Lincoln used to seek books from different places and read at
night in the light of the stove fire and gained knowledge. He was
self-educated and became a lawyer.
Abraham Lincoln became the President of America. He was the sixteenth
President of the United States. His tenure was from 1861 to 1865. He
was a skilled politician as well as a book-lover, serious thinker and
writer. He saved the country from being divided into two parts forever
and also freed the country from the horribly inhuman slave system.
