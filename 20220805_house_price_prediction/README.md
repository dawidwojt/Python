# 20220805_House_Price_Prediction
This project focuses on creating house price model based on data from Boston's 1970 house market.
It includes data preparation, visualisation and regresstion model where house price is being estimated. Explanatory variables are mainly:
 - number of bedrooms, 
 - distance to city / employment central areas,
 - neighbourhood richness / poorness
 - location by the riverside,
 - property age.

Generally, data seems to be old and inrellevant in these days reality, but I find some fact interesting and maybe what is even more important, it let's metodology speaks for itself/
What i mean by that - the results are pretty self explanatory and thanks to that, It is easy to verify that the model is created in a right way.
